	Special thanks to Prof. Legah of LandMark Technology for his resilient effort in teaching and 
	leading us throughout this journey. A shout out to Team Dominion and especially the team 
	leader Dr. (Mola) Forseh. He is a true leader and he believes in "never leave a team member

        Keys to success:
        ----------------
        The very first key to success is to make a plan. 
        This means having a clear picture of what a successful life looks like to you and 
        putting together a well-defined set of goals to get you to that life. ... 
        To succeed means to accomplish a goal. 
        By this definition, if you don't set goals, you'll never succeed.

        Key for successful life is dedication, hard work, motivation, 
       love towards what you do and importantly consistency.</h2>
